## Markov Chains

### Description
#### *Carnegie Mellon University, 21-241 Matrices and Linear Transformations, Final Project*
Markov Chains are collections of random variables that have the explict property that given the present, the future is conditionally independent of the past. Specifically this project explores Markov Chains and its implentation in the PageRank algorithm.


### For Testing Purposes 
#### Functions
- main: put new test data (list of lists) in the var adjList and this will print out the rankings
- rank: takes a 2d array (list of lists) and returns a single sorted list by index respective to the original (follows sample data structure)
